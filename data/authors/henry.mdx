Henry Yim is a Shopify AI & Commerce Engineer who helps brands prepare for the new era of AI-driven commerce.
He specializes in Shopify Plus architecture, headless storefronts, and intelligent product discovery — blending development, optimization, and machine learning to make stores faster, smarter, and more profitable.

Having built tools like Yep AI Chatbot and AI Feed Optimizer, he focuses on how LLMs, embeddings, and structured feeds will reshape e-commerce visibility — turning prompts into purchases.

When he’s not building, you’ll find him sketching product ideas, exploring emerging frameworks, or analyzing what makes digital experiences convert.
